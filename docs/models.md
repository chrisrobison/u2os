# Model providers

U2OS defaults to the deterministic `MockModelProvider`. Two real adapters are implemented, deliberately non-identical so the `ModelProvider` abstraction is proven rather than nominal:

- `openai-compatible` -- `POST <baseUrl>/v1/chat/completions`, `response_format: json_object`, bearer auth. Targets Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio, or a hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- `anthropic` -- `POST <baseUrl or https://api.anthropic.com>/v1/messages`, `x-api-key`/`anthropic-version` headers, a top-level `system` field instead of a system message, and no guaranteed JSON-only response mode (the provider strips one bounded markdown fence if the model wraps its answer in one).

In both cases the model is planning infrastructure only: returned JSON is validated by the shared `validatePlan()` against the registered tool names and argument schemas (server/agent/plan-validator.js) before anything reaches the policy engine, and every consequential proposal still passes through that same policy engine regardless of which provider produced it.

## Configuring a single provider (current HTTP API)

`POST /api/model`:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai-compatible",
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
  "model": "your-installed-model",
  "timeoutMs": 30000,
  "apiKey": "optional-for-local-endpoints"
}
```

or, for Anthropic:

```json
{ "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-...", "apiKey": "sk-ant-..." }
```

The endpoint and model name are stored in `U2OS_HOME/config/config.json`; a supplied API key is encrypted in the existing credential vault under `model-<provider>` and is never returned by `GET /api/model`. Restart U2OS after changing providers. Set `{ "provider": "mock" }` to return to the offline deterministic planner.

## ModelRouter and roles

`server/agent/model-router.js` resolves a provider for a role (`planner`, `classifier`, `summarizer`, `extractor`, `response`, `embeddings`, ...) from a small, deterministic config -- role name looks up a configured provider name, nothing more elaborate. `Agent` accepts either a single `modelProvider` (what every existing test and the single-provider HTTP config above still produce) or a `modelRouter`; `server/index.js` always builds a router via `createModelRouter()`, which normalizes the legacy single-provider config into one provider used for every role, so existing installations need no config change.

A multi-provider, per-role config is supported at the config-file level (there is no HTTP route to write one yet -- see Known limitations below):

```json
{
  "model": {
    "providers": {
      "local-planner": { "type": "openai-compatible", "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434", "model": "llama3" },
      "hosted": { "type": "anthropic", "model": "claude-...", "apiKeyRef": "hosted" }
    },
    "roles": { "planner": "local-planner", "classifier": "local-planner", "summarizer": "local-planner" },
    "fallback": "hosted"
  }
}
```

Each non-mock provider's API key is read from the vault under `model-provider-<apiKeyRef || providerName>`. If the role's primary provider throws while planning, `Planner` retries exactly once against the configured `fallback` provider (if any and if distinct from the primary) and records which provider actually produced the plan for the audit trail -- it never silently retries in a loop or auto-selects a "better" model.

## Known limitations

- No HTTP route yet writes a multi-provider/role config; only the single-provider shape is configurable from the UI.
- No embeddings-capable provider is implemented yet (the `embeddings` role has nothing real to resolve to besides a locally-configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint that happens to serve one).
- Bounded personal-context assembly for the Planner beyond tool listings is not implemented yet -- see docs/architecture.md's Agent decomposition section and PLAN.md.
- No streaming.
- Provider failure (including after a fallback attempt) is explicit and never silently executes a stale plan or bypasses policy.
